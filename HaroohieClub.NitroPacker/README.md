# NitroPacker

NitroPacker is a .NET library (and utility) for interacting with Nintendo DS ROMs, especially packing and unpacking them.
It is also capable of doing fairly complex ASM patching with the aid of devkitARM for assembly/compilation.

This README will be expanded in future versions to more comprehensively describe what NitroPacker is capable of.
For now, all the methods and classes have XML/IntelliSense documentation for ease of use.
